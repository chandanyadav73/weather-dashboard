A weather dashboard is a visual tool that provides real-time and forecasted weather information. It usually gathers data from meteorological sources and presents it in an intuitive interface with features like:

Current Weather Conditions: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation for a specific location.
Forecast: Shows short-term and long-term forecasts (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) with high and low temperatures, expected conditions, and chance of precipitation.
Interactive Map: Includes a map with overlays for radar, temperature, wind patterns, and weather alerts, helping users to see regional weather changes.
Weather Alerts: Warns users about severe weather events like storms, hurricanes, or heatwaves in specific regions.
Customization: Allows users to set their preferred locations, units (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit), and alert preferences.
